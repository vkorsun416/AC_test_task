                        All high quality gazebos at House of Tents have a high UV resistance - ideal for hot summer
                        days. If UV protection 30+ is enough for you, then the Rendezvous and Sunset steel garden
                        gazebos are just right. If you would like increased protection against UV radiation, then we
                        recommend either our PE marquees, our garden gazebos in the Premium and Deluxe lines, or our
                        Economy steel and Economy aluminium pop up gazebos. All these gazebo tents offer great UV
                        protection of SPF 50+. For the ultimate in sun protection all of our high quality PVC
                        (Profi-line) marquees, as well as the Premium steel and Professional aluminium pop up gazebos
                        offer UV protection of SPF 80+.

                        All gazebos at House of Tents are 100% waterproof. But especially in winter, a season with a lot
                        of wind and heavy rain, the gazebo frame makes all the difference. For example, heavy duty
                        gazebos are more weatherproof than wooden frames. Wooden gazebos are also waterproof, but over
                        time, the wood can rot and splinter. Steel gazebos on the other hand, are very weather-resistant
                        while aluminium gazebos provide the best protection from rust.
                        For garden gazebos that will be standing in one place over winter, we advise choosing a model
                        with a hardtop, as the heavy duty polycarbonate panels can stand up to the worst weather
                        conditions. Depending on the model, they can even withstand snow loads of 50 to 80 kg/mÂ².

                            canopies allow you to throw parties with less stress.
                            Celebrate birthdays, weddings or host events in your garden. All marquees from House of
                            Tents are 100% waterproof and if you choose a PVC garden tent, you will also be able to
                            enjoy shelter deep into the autumn. To ensure that your product also stands up to strong
                            winds, you will find accessories to increase its stability in our shop. Equip your marquee
                            with a base frame, for example. Thanks to the groundbar frame, the legs of your marquee
                            cannot slip in strong winds, giving it more support. Ground anchors for your patio or garden
                            are also advisable.

                            All pop up gazebos from House of Tents have a robust frame - made of either steel or
                            aluminium. These are available with a square or hexagonal profile. If a gazebo is to be
                            weatherproof, the tarpaulin must also be 100% waterproof. The tarpaulins of our pop up
                            gazebos are available in PVC as well as in PVC-coated high-performance polyester. The
                            special feature that ensures that these tarpaulins are waterproof? All seams are
                            thermo-sealed. The quality of the seams is therefore very high and prevents water from
                            penetrating the pop up gazebo. You will also find a large range of accessories for foldable
                            tents on our site.
                            For an impressive appearance, an awning is particularly recommended. This not only looks
                            very professional, but also protects against rain from the side and low sun. The tarpaulin
                            material of the awning also has a UV protection rating of SPF 80.

                            <b>Tip: </b>Pop up gazebos are an excellent solution for giving shelter and shade wherever
                            you need it. They are easy to erect, which make them the go-to choice as an event shelter at
                            outdoor
                            events. While they can't match the heavy duty weather resistance of other gazebo products,
                            it's easy to fold the structure up and pop a gazebo cover over the top. The cover will
                            protect the frame and canopy from the worst weather conditions.

                            Garden gazebos are available at House of Tents with a tarpaulin canopy as well as with a
                            fixed roof made of polycarbonate panels. Both shelters are 100% waterproof, stable and
                            UV-resistant. However, when the cold season arrives, we recommend that you remove the
                            tarpaulin canopy and put it into storage. This is because strong temperature fluctuations
                            can damage the polyester and, in the worst case, lead to breaks in the tarpaulin material.
                            The hardtop fixed roof, can remain outside in the garden throughout the winter. All garden
                            gazebos are delivered including sidewalls. With the sides, you can close the waterproof
                            gazebo completely or leave it open. The side wall panels can be hung loosely at the leg
                            poles, with sides connecting to each other with water-resistant zips. We recommend that you
                            close the sides overnight to ensure wind can't collect underneath the gazebo canopy.

                            <b>Tip: </b>There's nothing better than enjoying a small get-together with friends on a warm
                            summer
                            evening on the patio. Even better if you have a canopy over your hot tub. It can all be
                            ruined by mosquitos and midges though.
                            Side walls can be replaced with great quality mosquito nets with a fine mesh fabric from our
                            shops to keep bugs at bay. The Sunset Premium and Deluxe models have a double rail system so
                            the mosquito nets can be attached alongside the side walls.

                                You'll be hard pressed to find a large variety of sizes of gazebo, starting from 2x3
                                metre models, with 3x3m gazebos being our biggest sellers. Marquees extend to a maximum
                                size of 8x36m. For pop up gazebos our product range extends to 5x5m large gazebos.
                                Garden gazebos are available as either 3x3m or 3x4m structures.

                                The 3x3 m gazebo for example, is available at House of Tents in fifteen different
                                colours. Pop up gazebos come in the widest variety of colours ranging from white to grey
                                to intense colours such as petrol, orange or purple. For trade fairs or market stalls,
                                plain colours such as white and grey are particularly popular. Garden gazebos feature
                                classic tones that complement the outdoor environment such as stone and loft grey.
                                Marquees meanwhile come in white or dark green. A decorative striped pattern is also
                                possible with blue, grey, green or red stripes combining with white.

                                Yes! The sides of all of our gazebos and marquees, just like the canopies themselves,
                                are completely waterproof. Seams are welded with a waterproofing plastic sheet that
                                ensures that no water will enter the shelter from the sides. The side panels of the
                                marquee gazebos, for example, are made of high quality PVC and are 100% waterproof. You
                                will also find gable sides and side panels with built-in zip doors in our range of
                                accessories.
